Extraction of Features for embl file
=====================================

In order to quickly extract insertion Sequences (IS) from an annotated embl file, a Python script was generated. This script extracts IS (based on its key given in the annotation) plus 1 kbp of flanking region either side of the IS. 

A partner Python script is also able to exclude the IS sequence and merge the 1 kbp flanking regions.

Script usage is further documented within the script itself.
